# Global-Cancer-Fatality-Analysis-Power-BI
This project is about studying how cancer affects people all over the world. We are looking at different types of cancer like breast cancer, liver cancer, colon cancer, leukemia, brain and nervous system cancer, and stomach cancer. We are also looking at how these cancers affect people of different ages, from 4 to 70 years old.
