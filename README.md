# Global-Cancer-Fatality-Analysis-Power-BI Project
This project is about studying how cancer affects people all over the world. We are looking at different types of cancer like breast cancer, liver cancer, colon cancer, leukemia, brain and nervous system cancer, and stomach cancer. We are also looking at how these cancers affect people of different ages, from 4 to 70 years old.

The goal of this project is to help people better understand how cancer affects people around the world. We hope this information can be used to help fight cancer in the future.


 Conclusion:
My project on cancer deaths around the world has helped me understand how different types of cancer affect people of different ages in different countries. 
I used a tool called Power BI to make sense of the data I got from a website called Kaggle.


Even though the data was complex and my computer isn’t very powerful, I was able to complete my project. I learned a lot about how to manage resources and use software effectively.

This project showed me how important it is to understand health data like this. It can help us figure out how to fight diseases like cancer. I’m proud of what I’ve done and I’m excited to use what I’ve learned in the future. This project has been a great learning experience for me.
